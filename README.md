---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-enrollment-iscp.git
cd student-enrollment-iscp
```

> Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username if you forked the repo.

---

### 2. Setup Environment

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) / [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) / LAMP
- PHP 7.x or higher
- MySQL server

---

### 3. Configure Database Credentials

Open `artisan.php` and update these lines if needed:

```php
$host = 'localhost';
$user = 'root';      // your MySQL username
$pass = '';          // your MySQL password
```

---

### 4. Create the Database Automatically

Run the setup script to:

- Create the `student_enrollment` database
- Create `students` and `courses` tables
- Insert sample meme-style courses
- Insert 12 sample senators and assign them to courses

#### Run via browser:

Start Apache + MySQL in your local server (XAMPP or MAMP), then visit:

```
http://localhost/student-enrollment-iscp/artisan.php
```

#### Or run via terminal:

```bash
php artisan.php
```

You should see confirmation messages like:

```
Database 'student_enrollment' created or already exists.
Table 'courses' created.
Table 'students' created.
Sample courses inserted.
Sample students inserted and randomly enrolled in courses.
```

You can re-run `artisan.php` safely — it will clear `students` and `courses` tables before re-inserting sample data.

> ⚠️ Be careful if you already added real data; this will delete them!
